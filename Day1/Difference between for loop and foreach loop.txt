Difference between for loop and foreach loop is as follows:

1.
    - for loop iterates through items until a certain condition is true.
   You give an initial statement, a condition for which the loop is to be iterated until it gets false, 
   and a statement that will be executed after every successful block execution.

    - foreach loop is used to iterate through items in collections (Lists, Arrays etc.). 
   When you have a list of items, instead of using a for loop and iterate over the list using its index, 
   you can directly access each element in the list using a foreach loop.


2.
    - for loop can be illustrated as 

         int length = 100;  
      for (int index = 1; index < length; index++)  
      {  
       ...............
      }  

    - foreach loop can be illustrated as 

         int[] numbers={1,2,3,4,5}
         foreach(int item in numbers)  
            {  
                item+=1;            
            }
